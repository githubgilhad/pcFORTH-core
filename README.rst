pcFORTH-core
==============

A small Forth-like core for PC, for geting translation of new FORTH words to in-memory format, with all IMMEDIATE words already processed, so it could be saved into FLASH memory on memxFORTH. PC have a LOT more of memory for this kind of usage.

Based on `memxFORTH-core <https://github.com/githubgilhad/memxFORTH-core>`__
